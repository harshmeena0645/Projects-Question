Delivery man - Data Analysis

1. Can you briefly explain your Delivery Man Data Analysis project?
✅ Answer:
"I analyzed a dataset containing delivery personnel information, including age, ratings, vehicle type, and delivery times. The goal was to identify factors affecting delivery time and optimize delivery performance. I used data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to extract insights."

2. What were the key insights from your analysis?
✅ Answer:
•	Older delivery personnel (35+ years) tend to have slightly higher ratings.
•	Motorcycles are faster than scooters for deliveries.
•	Deliveries that start from restaurants farther from city centers take longer.
•	The average delivery time varies by order type, with Buffets taking the longest.
•	High-rated delivery persons tend to complete orders faster.

3. How did you handle missing or incorrect data in the dataset?
✅ Answer:
"I checked for missing values and used different approaches:
•	For missing delivery ratings, I replaced them with the average rating of the corresponding city.
•	For incorrect delivery times, I removed outliers using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
•	For inconsistent vehicle types, I mapped them to standard categories: 'motorcycle' or 'scooter'."

4. How did you visualize the data? Which tools did you use?
✅ Answer:
"I used Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python to create:
•	A scatter plot of delivery times vs. distance to check the impact of location.
•	A box plot of ratings to understand the distribution of delivery ratings.
•	A bar chart comparing vehicle types to identify which vehicle delivers faster.
These helped in making data-driven recommendations."

5. How would you optimize delivery time based on your analysis?
✅ Answer:
"I would suggest:
1.	Prioritizing motorcycles for long-distance deliveries.
2.	Assigning high-rated delivery persons to peak-hour orders for better efficiency.
3.	Reducing restaurant wait times by alerting staff when a delivery person is near.
4.	Providing incentives to delivery persons with fast and efficient service."

6. What challenges did you face while analyzing the data?
✅ Answer:
•	Missing and incorrect values in ratings and vehicle type.
•	Outliers in delivery times—some values were unrealistically high or low.
•	Different units for latitude/longitude, requiring geospatial calculations.
I overcame these by data cleaning, filtering outliers, and using geospatial distance formulas for better accuracy.

7. How did you calculate the delivery distance?
✅ Answer:
"I used the Haversine formula to calculate the great-circle distance between restaurant and delivery locations based on latitude and longitude."

8. If the company wanted to predict delivery time, which model would you use?
✅ Answer:
"I would use a Regression Model (like Linear Regression or Random Forest) with features like:
•	Distance between restaurant & delivery location
•	Type of vehicle used
•	Delivery person’s rating
•	Order type (snack, drinks, buffet)
This would help predict delivery times accurately."

9. How would you handle scalability if the dataset grows?
✅ Answer:
"I would optimize performance by:
1.	Using SQL-based databases instead of CSV files for faster queries.
2.	Implementing parallel processing using Dask or Spark for big data.
3.	Applying feature engineering to reduce unnecessary columns."

10. How does this project relate to real-world business impact?
✅ Answer:
"My analysis can help companies like Zomato or Swiggy improve:
•	Delivery efficiency by optimizing routes and assigning orders smartly.
•	Customer satisfaction by ensuring faster and more reliable deliveries.
•	Delivery cost reduction by identifying areas where scooter deliveries take too long."
